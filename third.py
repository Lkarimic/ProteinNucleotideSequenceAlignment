#This file contains alignment of protein and nucleotide sequences. 
#Firstly, we recognize if sequence is a nucleotide or a protein.
#Secondly, from nucleotide sequences we extract potential coding subsequence (from START to STOP codon). 
#Thirdly, codons are translated into aminoacids. 
#Finally, protein sequences are aligned.
