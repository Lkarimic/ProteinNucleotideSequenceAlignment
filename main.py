#This file is a main file for project of Protein/Nucleotide Sequence Alignment. 
#It contains interface to the four parts which make a whole, those are the following:
#1. Global and local alignment of nucleotide sequences using given matrix as a score matrix 
#2. Global and local alignments of protein sequences using PAM and BLOOSUM score matrices 
#3. Alignment of protein or nucleotide sequences, depending on the type
#4. Alignment of multiple sequences using CLUSTALW algorithm
