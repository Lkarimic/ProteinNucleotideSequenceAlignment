# ProteinNucleotideSequenceAlignment
This project is a part of my Master Studies' Bioinformatics Course. The main idea is to do various types of alignment of nucleotide sequences and proteins using score matrices. All code is done in Python.
The main tasks are the following:
1. Global and local alignment of nucleotide sequences using given matrix as a score matrix 
2. Global and local alignments of protein sequences using PAM and BLOSUM score matrices 
3. Alignment of protein or nucleotide sequences, depending on the type
4. Alignment of multiple sequences using CLUSTALW algorithm
