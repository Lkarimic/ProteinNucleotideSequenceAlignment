#This file contains global and local alignments of protein sequences using PAM(global alignment) and BLOSUM(local alignment) score matrix
#PAM trace evolutionary origins of proteins, BLOSUM score alignment between evolutionarily-divergent proteins 
#PAM High number: compares distantly related proteins 
#BLOSUM High number : compares closely related proteins
